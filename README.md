# Discord-Token-Grabber

After just a few days messing with JavaScript in discord console and spending hours looking up tutorials, I have finally made a not only functioning token grabber but one where the victim pasting the code in console is clueless due to it's invisibility.
To make this code more believabled I would advise to pair it up with another js for discord console so that it looks like it's just part of whatever the feature is.
This grabber works by first you making a webhook then the code sending a message through your webhook with the user's token and id to whatever channel the webhook is on. This even works if the victim is not in your server, which is the point considering you'd want it to be a private server, they just have to paste the code into their console.
