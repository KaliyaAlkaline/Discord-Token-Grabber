# Discord-Token-Grabber

After just a few days messing with JavaScript in discord console and spending hours looking up tutorials, I have finally made a not only functioning token grabber but one where the victim pasting the code in console is clueless due to it's invisibility.
To make this code more believabled I would advise to pair it up with another js for discord console so that it looks like it's just part of whatever the feature is.
This grabber works by you making a webhook then the code making the webhook send the user's token and id to whater channel its on.
